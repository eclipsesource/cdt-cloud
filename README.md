# CDT.cloud Blueprint
CDT.cloud Blueprint is a template tool for building custom, web-based C/C++ tools. It is made of existing open source components and provides a typical C/C++ IDE based on the Eclipse Theia platform. Please see more information on the [project homepage](https://cdt-cloud.io)

CDT.cloud Blueprint compiles existing open source components into a installable project. You can adapt the build configuration and enhance it to match your custom requirements. The build configuration of CDT.cloud Blueprint is currently hosted as part of the Eclipse Theia blueprint project (see [here]()).
This repository is currently for raising questions and reporting bugs specific to CDT.cloud Blueprint only.
